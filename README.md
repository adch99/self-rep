# A Self Reproducing Program 
This project aims to make a program and environment scripts that do the following

* Reproduces itself
* Runs the copy and itself again
* The environment scripts emulate decomposition.

Thus the programs must emulate evolution in the long run.

This should happen because:

1. The space and cpu resources are limited by the environment scripts and hardware restrictions.
2. There is a sufficient chance for error in the copying mechanism.
3. The programs will compete for resources and adapt with artificial natural selection (pun intended).
